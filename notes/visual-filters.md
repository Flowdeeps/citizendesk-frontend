Currently i see the following plottable quantities:

- date, either bars or line
- location, just for monitors with a location query
- users (authors), with a long tail
- channels, that can be typed. a type is `twitter`

For the monitors a powerful metric appeared to be the entities, at
least the hashtags. The problem there though is the algorithm to use
in order to allow grouping and exploration using an information which
is like a tag, with several values for every entity.
