msgid "<i>Monitors</i> follow your search terms in Twitter in real time. They will periodically show you the most recent tweets about the topic you set. You have to set your monitor to include keywords (like \"Obama\"), Twitter user names (like @joesmith), or hashtags (like #eurovision). You can monitor multiple items - just separate each monitored phrase with a comma. Since this may result in a huge amount of reports from Twitter, we only support search terms with a reduced number of matches. A typical use for a monitor is to watch your own Twitter username and the usernames of others."
