### Citizendesk frontend

This is the frontend for Citizendesk. It will serve a web interface
connected with a [Citizendesk interface][interface] component.

#### Deployment

This is an Angular application produced with Yeoman, and as such it
can be deployed just serving the static files under `app/`. Remember
to install the Bower dependencies running bower install:

    $ bower install

In order to work, the front end has to be connected to a [Citizendesk
interface][interface] component, and you have to write its address in
the file `app/scripts/services/prefix.js`.
